Problem Description: Refer to the course registration system case study and answer the following questions.

Situation: A Course Registration System needs to be developed for an engineering college. The college wants an automated system to replace its manual system for the purpose of registration of students to branches and calculation of fees for each year. The engineering college provides graduation courses in various branches of engineering. The system will be used by the admin staff to register students admitted to the college to the branches at the time of joining the college and also to calculate the yearly fees for the students. The student has to register every year for the next academic year. The Admin takes care of the yearly registration of the students and the calculation of yearly fees. The system needs to be authenticated with a login id and password. Registration of a student to a branch is based on the qualifying exam marks and the entrance counseling. For every branch, a yearly branch fee is applicable. Discounts are given to the branch fees of the first year based on the qualifying exam marks. There is a registration fees also applicable to the first year students. Students can opt to be a day scholar or hostelite. Yearly bus fees are applicable for all the day scholars based on the distance of travel. Yearly hostel fees are applicable for all the hostelites. Yearly infrastructure fees and library fees are also applicable to all the students. Admin calculates the yearly college fees for each student and the college fees include all the fees specified earlier based on the type of student. Admin will provide a printed receipt of the fees to the students once the annual college fees have been paid. At the time of registration, student has to provide the permanent address and in case the student is opting to be a day scholar, he/she has to provide the residential address also. Assumption:

Decision of the branch of study a student is allocated, is not within the scope of this case study

custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood object oriented fundamentals - Access Specifiers, Variables – Local and Instance variables.

Assignment 48
Objective: Given a class diagram for an use case representing a computational problem, use the ‘self’ reference to create and initialize instance variables of a class and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: Let us revisit the class diagram drawn and implemented for Customer class as part of Object Oriented Fundamentals.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
-telephoneno : long
---
+setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+settelephoneno(long) : void
+gettelephoneno() : long
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs and observe the results.

class Customer:
    def setcustomerid(self, customerid):
        customerid = customerid 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno):
        telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self):
        return customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return telephoneno 
    
    
custobj = Customer() 
custobj.setcustomerid(1001) 
custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Note: Without ‘self’, it will be considered as normal local variable and that will be removed at the end of the scope of method. Hence, it is not possible to access it from outside of the method where it is defined.

Revised Code

class Customer:
    def setcustomerid(self, customerid):
        self.customerid = customerid 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno):
        self.telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self):
        return self.customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return self.telephoneno 
    
    
custobj = Customer() 
custobj.setcustomerid(1001) 
custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Note: “self” is not a keyword and has no special meaning in Python. We can use any name in that place. However, it is recommended not to use any name other than “self” (merely a convention and for readability)

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have learnt the usage of self reference for accessing the instance variables using a retail application scenario

Assignment 49
Objective: Observe the need for features in the retail application scenario to correlate the application of initializing the members and ‘static’ members

Assignment 50
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, initialize the data members using init() method and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: In the retail application, as a customer is registered to the retail shop, the details of the customer must also be initialized.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
-telephoneno : long[]
-customername : String
---
+ setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+settelephoneno(long[]) : void
+gettelephoneno() : long[]
+setcustomername(String) : void
+getcustomername() : String
+validatecustomername() : boolean
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs and observe the results.

class Customer: 
    def __init__(self, customerid, telephoneno, customername): 
        self.__customerid=customerid 
        self.__customername=customername 
        self.__telephoneno=telephoneno 
        
    def setcustomerid(self, id): 
        self.__customerid = id 
    
    def setcustomername(self, customername): 
        self.__customername = customername 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno): 
        self.__telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return self.__telephoneno 
    
    def getcustomername(self): 
        return self.__customername 
    
    def validatecustomername(self): 
        if(len(self.__customername)>=3 and len(self.__customername) <=20): 
            return True
        else: return False

custobj = Customer(1001, telephoneno, "Kevin") 
if(custobj.validatecustomername()): 
    print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
    temp = custobj.gettelephoneno() 
    print("Telephone Nos : ", temp[0], ",", temp[1], ",", temp[2]) 
    print("Customer Name : ", custobj.getcustomername()) 
else: 
    print("Invalid customer name. Customer name must be between 3 and 20 characters")
Points to keep in mind

1. There is no default __init()__ method in Python as like we have default constructor in Java. Hence, we have to initialize some value to the variable if we want to use it in the program later.
2. No…Values initialized for each customer must be different. It depends on each customer. This can be achieved using parameterized __init__()
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of init() method and the need of parameterized init() using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 51

    print("Customer Name : ", custobj.getcustomername()) 
else: 
    print("Invalid customer name. Customer name must be between 3 and 20 characters")
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of parameterized init() method and the need of parameterized init() using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 52
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, use static/class variable and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: In the retail application, each time a customer is registered, customer id must be automatically generated starting from 1001. Also, retail shop management wants to know how many customers have registered at a point of time.

Note: Few instance variables are not shown in the class diagram so as to keep the code simple to understand.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
---
+Customer()
+setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+totalnoofcustomers() : int
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

class Customer: 
    counter = 1000 
    def __init__(self): 
        Customer.counter = Customer.counter+1 
        self.__customerid=Customer.counter 
        
    def setcustomerid(self, cid): 
        self.__customerid=cid 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    @staticmethod 
    def totalcustomers(): 
        return Customer.counter-1000 
    
objcust = Customer()     
print("Customer Id: ", objcust.getcustomerid()) 

objcust2 = Customer() 
print("Customer Id: ", objcust2.getcustomerid()) 
print("Total Customers: ", objcust.totalcustomers()) 
print("Total Customers: ", objcust2.totalcustomers()) 
print("Total Customers: ", Customer.totalcustomers())
Note: customerId is an instance variable of Customer class and it will be created separately for each and every object of Customer class. Hence each time an object of Customer class is created, constructor is called and customerId will be initialized to 1000 and will be incremented by 1 in the constructor as a result for all the objects customerId will remain as 1001. Hence we need to have a variable common to all the objects of Customer class

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of instatnce methods and static methods.

On the other hand, privileged customers hold membership card – Platinum, Gold or Silver based on which they receive gifts on each purchase. This is in addition to having all the properties of a customer. Thus in this case, Customer is the generalized case and Regular and Privileged customer are the specialized cases of Customer

The retail store management wants to keep track of the address of every customer so as to allow for home delivery at a later point of time. a. How many fields represent the address? b. Do you think address qualifies to be a class? c. What do you think is the relationship between Customer and Address? d. How can this relationship be represented using class diagram?
Note: Address can be considered as a separate class since the same class if required can be reused at a later point of time. For example, if retail store needs to keep track of its employees address, the same address class can be reused. The relationship between Customer class and Address class will be “Has –A” relationship since every customer has an address.

Consider PurchaseBill and PrintDetails classes, the bill needs to be created in a particular format. PrintDetails class contains methods which can be used to display the bill in the required format. a. What do you think is the relationship between PurchaseBill and PrintDetails classes? b. How can this relations
Note: As stated, PrintDetails class contains methods which can be used to display the bill in the required format. Hence the relationship between PurchaseBill and PrintDetails class is “uses-a” relationship

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the need of relationships and its representation using a retail application scenario

Problem Description: In the retail application, there are many customers who visit the retail outlet to purchase various items. The manager of the retail outlet now wants to keep track of all its customers’ data. Let us assume that customer details include Customer Id and Telephone Number.

For the class diagram identified in OO Fundamentals, implement the class using Eclipse IDE and execute it by writing a starter class.

Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs and understand the following:

Access Specifiers
Variables – Local and Instance variables
Methods
Starter class
Creation of objects
Reference variables
Compilation and Execution of a python program
class Customer:
    def setcustomerid(self, id1):
        self.__customerid = id1
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno):
        self.__telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self):
        return self.__customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self):
        return self.__telephoneno 
    
custobj = Customer() 
custobj.setcustomerid(1001,)
custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood object oriented fundamentals - Access Specifiers, Variables – Local and Instance variables.

Assignment 48
Objective: Given a class diagram for an use case representing a computational problem, use the ‘self’ reference to create and initialize instance variables of a class and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: Let us revisit the class diagram drawn and implemented for Customer class as part of Object Oriented Fundamentals.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
-telephoneno : long
---
+setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+settelephoneno(long) : void
+gettelephoneno() : long
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs and observe the results.

class Customer:
    def setcustomerid(self, customerid):
        customerid = customerid 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno):
        telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self):
        return customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return telephoneno 
    
    
custobj = Customer() 
custobj.setcustomerid(1001) 
custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Note: Without ‘self’, it will be considered as normal local variable and that will be removed at the end of the scope of method. Hence, it is not possible to access it from outside of the method where it is defined.

Revised Code

class Customer:
    def setcustomerid(self, customerid):
        self.customerid = customerid 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno):
        self.telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self):
        return self.customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return self.telephoneno 
    
    
custobj = Customer() 
custobj.setcustomerid(1001) 
custobj.settelephoneno(9201861311) 
print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
print("Telephone No : ", custobj.gettelephoneno())
Note: “self” is not a keyword and has no special meaning in Python. We can use any name in that place. However, it is recommended not to use any name other than “self” (merely a convention and for readability)

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have learnt the usage of self reference for accessing the instance variables using a retail application scenario

Assignment 49
Objective: Observe the need for features in the retail application scenario to correlate the application of initializing the members and ‘static’ members

Problem Description: In the retail application, each time a customer is registered, customer id must be automatically generated starting from 1001 and the details of the customer must be initialized. Also, retail shop management wants to know how many customers have registered at a point of time.

Answer the following question:

What do you think is needed to implement the solution for the above problem?
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have learnt

The need of __init__() method and static keyword in the retail application scenario
Assignment 50
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, initialize the data members using init() method and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: In the retail application, as a customer is registered to the retail shop, the details of the customer must also be initialized.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
-telephoneno : long[]
-customername : String
---
+ setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+settelephoneno(long[]) : void
+gettelephoneno() : long[]
+setcustomername(String) : void
+getcustomername() : String
+validatecustomername() : boolean
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs and observe the results.

class Customer: 
    def __init__(self, customerid, telephoneno, customername): 
        self.__customerid=customerid 
        self.__customername=customername 
        self.__telephoneno=telephoneno 
        
    def setcustomerid(self, id): 
        self.__customerid = id 
    
    def setcustomername(self, customername): 
        self.__customername = customername 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno): 
        self.__telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return self.__telephoneno 
    
    def getcustomername(self): 
        return self.__customername 
    
    def validatecustomername(self): 
        if(len(self.__customername)>=3 and len(self.__customername) <=20): 
            return True
        else: return False 
        
telephoneno=[9201861311, 9201861321, 9201661311] 
custobj = Customer(1001, telephoneno, "Kevin") 
if(custobj.validatecustomername()): 
    print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
    temp = custobj.gettelephoneno() 
    print("Telephone Nos : ", temp[0], ",", temp[1], ",", temp[2]) 
    print("Customer Name : ", custobj.getcustomername()) 
else: 
    print("Invalid customer name. Customer name must be between 3 and 20 characters")
Points to keep in mind

1. There is no default __init()__ method in Python as like we have default constructor in Java. Hence, we have to initialize some value to the variable if we want to use it in the program later.
2. No…Values initialized for each customer must be different. It depends on each customer. This can be achieved using parameterized __init__()
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of init() method and the need of parameterized init() using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 51
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, initialize the data members using default constructors, parameterized init() and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: In the retail application, as a customer is registered to the retail shop, the details of the customer must also be initialized.

The class diagram discussed in Object Oriented Fundamentals Assignment 51 has been modified as shown below.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
-telephoneno : long[]
-customername : String
---
+ Customer(int, long[], String)
+ setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+settelephoneno(long[]) : void
+gettelephoneno() : long[]
+setcustomername(String) : void
+getcustomername() : String
+validatecustomername() : boolean
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

class Customer: 
    def __init__(self, customerid, telephoneno, customername): 
        self.__customerid=customerid 
        self.__customername=customername 
        self.__telephoneno=telephoneno 
        
    def setcustomerid(self, id): 
        self.__customerid = id 
        
    def setcustomername(self, customername): 
        self.__customername = customername 
        
    def settelephoneno(self, teleno): 
        self.__telephoneno = teleno 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    def gettelephoneno(self): 
        return self.__telephoneno 
    
    def getcustomername(self):
        return self.__customername
    
    def validatecustomername(self): 
        if(len(self.__customername)>=3 and len(self.__customername) <=20): 
            return True 
        
        else: 
            return False 
        
telephoneno=[9201861311, 9201861321, 9201661311] 
custobj = Customer(1001, telephoneno, "Kevin") 
if(custobj.validatecustomername()): 
    print("Customer Id : ", custobj.getcustomerid()) 
    temp = custobj.gettelephoneno() 
    print("Telephone Nos : ", temp[0], ",", temp[1], ",", temp[2]) 
    print("Customer Name : ", custobj.getcustomername()) 
else: 
    print("Invalid customer name. Customer name must be between 3 and 20 characters")
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of parameterized init() method and the need of parameterized init() using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 52
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, use static/class variable and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: In the retail application, each time a customer is registered, customer id must be automatically generated starting from 1001. Also, retail shop management wants to know how many customers have registered at a point of time.

Note: Few instance variables are not shown in the class diagram so as to keep the code simple to understand.

Class diagram:

Customer
-customerid : int
---
+Customer()
+setcustomerid(int) : void
+getcustomerid() : int
+totalnoofcustomers() : int
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

class Customer: 
    counter = 1000 
    def __init__(self): 
        Customer.counter = Customer.counter+1 
        self.__customerid=Customer.counter 
        
    def setcustomerid(self, cid): 
        self.__customerid=cid 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    @staticmethod 
    def totalcustomers(): 
        return Customer.counter-1000 
    
objcust = Customer()     
print("Customer Id: ", objcust.getcustomerid()) 

objcust2 = Customer() 
print("Customer Id: ", objcust2.getcustomerid()) 
print("Total Customers: ", objcust.totalcustomers()) 
print("Total Customers: ", objcust2.totalcustomers()) 
print("Total Customers: ", Customer.totalcustomers())
Note: customerId is an instance variable of Customer class and it will be created separately for each and every object of Customer class. Hence each time an object of Customer class is created, constructor is called and customerId will be initialized to 1000 and will be incremented by 1 in the constructor as a result for all the objects customerId will remain as 1001. Hence we need to have a variable common to all the objects of Customer class

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of instatnce methods and static methods.

Assignment 53
Objective: Observe the need for features in the retail application scenario to correlate the application of method overloading

Problem Description: The Retail Store has the requirement for printing many reports including the bill. All reports contain header. The header may be

a line containing a character printed 70 times or
a title of a report or
a line containing a character specified number of times
Answer the following questions:

1. Which object oriented concept do you think is needed to implement this scenario?
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the need of method overloading using a retail application scenario

Assignment 54
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, use method and constructor overloading techniques to solve the problem and test using a set of values in an IDE

Problem Description: The scenario discussed in OO Concepts Part I Assignment 1 is revisited here. The Retail Store has the requirement for printing many reports including the bill. All reports contain header. The header may be

a line containing a character printed 70 times or
a title of a report or
a line containing a character specified number of times
A new class called PrintDetails with overloaded methods have to be created as shown below:

PrintDetails
+printHeader (char c): void
+printHeader (char c,int no): void
+printHeader (String c): void
Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

class PrintDetails:
    def printheader(self, c='*', no=1):
        print(c * no) 
        
obj = PrintDetails()    
obj.printheader('#', 10)
obj.printheader("Report")
obj.printheader('#' ,10)
obj.printheader()
Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have learnt the need and implementation of method with default parameters using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 55
Objective: Observe the need for features in the retail application scenario to correlate the application of relationships concept Problem Description:

The retail shop has two types of customers, Regular and Privileged. a. What are the properties common to all Customers? b. What are the properties which are different for the two kinds of customers? c. What is the relationship between i. Customer and Regular customer ii. Customer and Privileged customer? d. How can this relationship be represented using class diagram?
Note: Regular customers are entitled to get some discount on each purchase apart from having all the properties of a customer. On the other hand, privileged customers hold membership card – Platinum, Gold or Silver based on which they receive gifts on each purchase. This is in addition to having all the properties of a customer. Thus in this case, Customer is the generalized case and Regular and Privileged customer are the specialized cases of Customer

The retail store management wants to keep track of the address of every customer so as to allow for home delivery at a later point of time. a. How many fields represent the address? b. Do you think address qualifies to be a class? c. What do you think is the relationship between Customer and Address? d. How can this relationship be represented using class diagram?
Note: Address can be considered as a separate class since the same class if required can be reused at a later point of time. For example, if retail store needs to keep track of its employees address, the same address class can be reused. The relationship between Customer class and Address class will be “Has –A” relationship since every customer has an address.

Consider PurchaseBill and PrintDetails classes, the bill needs to be created in a particular format. PrintDetails class contains methods which can be used to display the bill in the required format. a. What do you think is the relationship between PurchaseBill and PrintDetails classes? b. How can this relations
Note: As stated, PrintDetails class contains methods which can be used to display the bill in the required format. Hence the relationship between PurchaseBill and PrintDetails class is “uses-a” relationship

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the need of relationships and its representation using a retail application scenario

Assignment 56
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, implement inheritance (single level, multilevel and hierarchical) to solve the problem, trace the flow of the program between the base and derived classes and test using a set of values in an IDE and recognize the benefits of inheritance

Problem Description: In the retail application, we have already seen that customers are of two types – Regular and Privileged. Regular customers are entitled for discount on each purchase and Privileged customers hold membership cards – Platinum, Gold or Silver based on which they are entitled to get gifts on each purchase.

The class diagram presented to you as part of OO Concepts Part I Assignment 5 has been modified to represent the inheritance relationship.

Note: Few instance variables and methods are not shown in the class diagram so as to keep the code simple to understand.

Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

objr.setdiscount(10.0) 
print("Regular Customer Details") 
print("Customer Id: ", objr.getcustomerid()) 
print("Customer Name: ", objr.getcustomername()) 
print("Discount Eligible: ", 
objr.getdiscount()) 
print("*********") 
objp = PrivilegedCustomer() 
objp.setcustomerid(1002) 
objp.setcustomername("Seetha") 
objp.setmemcardtype("Gold") 
print("Regular Customer Details") 
print("Customer Id: ", objp.getcustomerid()) 
print("Customer Name: ", objp.getcustomername()) 
print("Discount Eligible: ", objp.getmemcardtype())
Note: Instance variables can be initialized at object creation using init()

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have revisited concepts of inheritance through code snippets

Assignment 58
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, implement has-a and uses-a relationships to solve the problem and test using a set of values in an IDE and recognize the benefits of the mentioned relationships

Problem Description: In the retail application, we have already seen that every customer has an address. Address consists of address line, city, state and zipcode.

The class diagram presented to you as part of aggregation (has-a) example in OO Concepts Part I Assignment 7 has been modified.

Note: Few instance variables and methods are not shown in the class diagram so as to keep the code simple to understand. Similarly, regular and privileged customer classes are also not shown here.

Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results.

class Address: 
    def __init__(self, addressline, city, state, zip1): 
        self.__addressline = addressline 
        self.__city=city 
        self.__state=state 
        self.__zip=zip1
        
    def setaddressline(self, address): 
        self.__addressLine = address 
        
    def getaddressline(self): 
        return self.__addressline 
    
    def setcity(self, city): 
        self.__city = city 
        
    def getcity(self): 
        return self.__city
    
    def setstate(self, state): 
        self.__state = state 
        
    def getstate(self): 
        return self.__state 
    
    def setzip(self, zip1): 
        self.__zip = zip1 
        
    def getzip(self): 
        return self.__zip 
    
class Customer: 
    def __init__(self, cid, address): 
        self.__customerid = cid 
        self.__address = address 
        
    def getcustomerid(self): 
        return self.__customerid 
    
    def getaddress(self): 
        return self.__address 
    
objaddress = Address("No.333,Oak street", "Strathfield", "New South Wales", "570018") 
objcust = Customer(1001, objaddress) 
print("Customer Id:", objcust.getcustomerid()) 
address = objcust.getaddress() 
print("Customer Address: ", address.getaddressline(), ",", address.getcity(), ",", address.getstate(), ",", address.getzip())
Note: In this example, Address reference is passed to the __init() of Customer class. Since it is a reference of an object that is passed, the parameter passing technique used is pass by referene.

Summary of this assignment: In this assignment, you have understood the implementation of aggregation relationship using a retail application scenario.

Assignment 59
Objective: Given a class diagram for a use case representing a computational problem, implement has-a and uses-a relationships to solve the problem and test using a set of values in an IDE and recognize the benefits of the mentioned relationships

Problem Description: In the retail application, we have already seen that purchase bill has to be created in a particular format.

The class diagram presented to you as part of association (uses-a) example in OO Concepts Part I Assignment 7 has been modified to include instance variables and methods

Note: Few instance variables and methods are not shown in the class diagram so as to keep the code simple to understand.

Code: Execute the code using Eclipse IDE with the given inputs in the starter class, Retail and observe the results. Few changes are made to PurchaseBill class, the changes are highlighted in the code below:
